## Who Am I?

I'm Kayne Ruse, of KR Game Studios. I've published games commercially on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/868880/Candy_Raid_The_Factory/) and [Drive Thru Cards](https://www.drivethrucards.com/product/305213/Potion-School), and I've managed several teams in that time. I've also built many [marketing websites](https://candyraid.com/), and have a (very) small following.

## How does this work?

I'm offering a no-strings-attached prize to the top three entries of this competition. All participants will retain the full rights to their games.

I'm also offering a negotiable publishing deal with the 1st place winner, and potentially other participants if their games are impressive enough.

Entries should run on either Windows, Linux or be easily printable with a color printer.

## Time Frame

Development will take place during the month of June, 2020. I expect all entries to be submitted by 11:59pm, June 30th AEST. Late entries won't be considered unless you ask *really nicely*.

## Theme and Constraints

**Theme**: "Rolling"

Prototypes and content-incomplete games are welcome, but they will be judged with the same scrutiny as everything else.

Please keep your game closed-source for now.

If there are unusual aspects of your game, please include the instructions in the submission email (I once worked on an MMO driven by discord bots!)
