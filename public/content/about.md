# My name is Kayne Ruse.

I've been making games since I was 13, which is over half my life now; I was born with a controller in my hand. I finished highschool in 2009, I studied game development at TAFE for 2 years, and I've been trying to break into the industry ever since.

I have tons of hands-on experience, having taught myself most of what I know. I'm now trying to build KR Game Studios as a viable business.
